If you will generate the eukaryotes disorder output (long and short) locally on your machine, please make sure to rename the CSV compiled file to be 
eukaryotes_complete_filtered_long.result and eukaryotes_complete_filtered_short.result, respectively. 
This will ensure the running of Jupyter notbooks without any problem.
